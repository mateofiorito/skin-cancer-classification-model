# Skin Cancer Classification Model
This repository contains all the code from a notebook in which I built a machine learning model able to classify moles between malignant and benign.

# Skin Cancer
Skin cancer, which forms on or within the skin, is the most common type of cancer in the United States. Basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma are the most common kinds of skin cancer.

# Early Detection of Skin Cancer
Early detection saves lives. Learning what to look for on your own skin gives you the power to detect cancer early when it’s easiest to cure, before it can become dangerous, disfiguring, or deadly. With the advancement of AI technology, having a model capable of identifying skin cancer can significantly enhance this early detection process. AI can assist in quickly analyzing skin changes or abnormalities, providing an additional layer of accuracy and speed in identifying potential skin cancer. By incorporating AI into routine skin checks, individuals and healthcare professionals can detect cancer earlier, increasing the chances of successful treatment and reducing the need for more invasive procedures.

I share this AI model because I believe in making life-saving tools accessible to everyone. Early detection of skin cancer is crucial.
